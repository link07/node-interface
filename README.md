# Litecoin Node Interface

This is a basic web interface to a Litecoin full node. The code is not very good, but works on my serverâ„¢.

If you have any suggestion or problem, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

### Requirements

1. Litecoin full node with username/password authentication.
2. Web server with PHP(5) and the curl extension.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo or extract the files on any public folder.
2. Copy or rename config-example.php to config.php and edit it.

The `serverurl`, `username` and `password` options are required.

### License
